      Dear Steph, you'll probably find this  really corny but I don't care, this took me way too much time not to go all out. Our relationship is one of the most unexpected things to happen and I am so grateful we didn't just stay as friends. I always felt we had a deeper connection. I wrote this to show you that I'm taking this seriously. I feel like I'm a different person when I'm around you, I know it sounds cliche but its true. Mogawas akong childish nga side and I always find that hard to do with certain people.
      <br>
You are the most talented person I know. Like legit no cap. Its one of the reasons I fell in love. I like how our personalities clash perfectly because I see you as left brain dominant (creative, talented, quirky) and I'm right-brained (nerd). I love how our relationship has its own inside jokes, I just feel so free and it makes me feel like I have no responsibilities to worry about. Even just being silent and doing nothing with you is enough. I hope this continues for as long as we can. I didn't really expect myself to be doing all this all I know is YOU made the first move. Luv ya.
    </p>
